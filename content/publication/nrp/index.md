abstract: "Combating climate change requires drastic changes in behaviour at both the individual and societal levels. Evidence from behavioural science provides a powerful toolkit for making such changes happen. For example, manipulating how choices are presented can ‘nudge’ people to choose more energy-efficient options, and providing feedback on energy use can prompt people to adjust their behaviour accordingly"
